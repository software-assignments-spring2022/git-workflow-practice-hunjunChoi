# Is 5G here?

[Without a Killer App, Who Needs 5G?](https://www.pcmag.com/news/without-a-killer-app-who-needs-5g)

-   5G, the fifth-generation mobile network, is a new kind of wireless technology able to connect any devices using the network together. Designed with low latency and high data speeds, 5G is promised to deliver next-generation user experiences and novel services such as AR/VR for gaming, smart transportation application, and remote operations that will reorganize every industry. Although the burgeoning demand for 5G from consumers, the network still faces challenges that inhibit its accessibility. Apart from the network's ongoing coverage issue, the lack of a killer app, an indispensable application, is viewed as a major hindrance.
-   Despite the availability of 5G since 2019, the absence of 'must-have app' makes the end-users to perceive the technology hasn't arrived. The previous generation, 4G, has modified smartphones into a personal computer capable of live streaming videos and pin down accurate location through various maps. On the other hand, utilizations of 5G are not as visible as they were to 4G. Takeaway here is that advent of innovative technology incorporates the advancement of other technologies. Without the software applications adapted to its supporting technology, innovation is incomplete.
